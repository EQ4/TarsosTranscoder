Tarsos Transcoder
=======================
Tarsos Transcoder is a library to transcode audio with JAVA.

Downloads and more info on http://tarsos.0110.be/tag/TarsosTranscoder

It uses (platform dependent) FFmpeg binaries in the background. It is
a fork of JAVE (Java Audio and Video Encoder) by Carlo Pelliccia 
(www.sauronsoftware.it).

Tarsos Audio Transcoder focuses only on audio and it is compatible 
with more, and more recent FFmpeg binaries and it less dependent on 
text output of the different binaries. The interface is also 
simplified.

INTERFACE
=========
To use the transcoder you need to call Transcoder. It is as simple as:

Transcoder.transcode("foo.mp3","foo.wav",DefaultAttributes.WAV_PCM_S16LE_STEREO_44KHZ);

FFmpeg can encode to a lot of formats and can decode even more.


INNER WORKINGS
==============
Tarsos Transcoder tries to find an FFmpeg binary in the path of the system.
If it does not find one it tries to copy a binary for the current platform.
Tarsos Transcoder contains three binaries: one for MAC OS X, one for Linux
(x86) and one for windows. Tarsos Transcoder has been tested on:

* MAC OS X 10.6
* Windows 7 
* Ubuntu linux 10.10 ARM 
* Ubuntu Linux 10.04 x86_64

It will probably work most of the time.

ALT BINARIES
============
Providing binaries for your (unsupported) platform can be done by implementing
FFMPEGLocator. The PickMe method should yield true on your platform and copy e.g.
an FFmpeg binary to a temporary directory.
