Tarsos Audio Transcoder
=======================

Tarsos Audio Transcoder is a library to transcode audio with JAVA.
It uses (platform dependent) FFMPEG binaries in the background. It is
a fork of JAVE (Java Audio and Video Encoder) by Carlo Pelliccia 
(www.sauronsoftware.it). 

Tarsos Audio Transcoder focuses only on audio and it is compatible 
with more, and more recent FFMPEG binaries and it less dependent on 
text output of the different binaries. The interface is also 
simplified.

INTERFACE
=========

To use the transcoder you need to call Transcoder. It is as simple as that:

Transcoder.transcode("foo.mp3","foo.wav",DefaultAttributes.WAV_PCM_S16LE_STEREO_44KHZ);

FFMPEG can encode to a lot of formats and can decode even more.

ALT BINARIES
============

Providing binaries for your (unsupported) platform can be done by implementing
FFMPEGLocator. The PickMe method should yield true on your platform and copy e.g.
an ffmpeg binary to the temporary directory.
